<h3>Editor's note</h3><div class="content"><p>Hello everyone and welcome to April�s <span class="strong">Clan Submissions Page!</span> It�s been a very exciting time around RuneScape with the release of the new skill and work ongoing with the planning of this year�s <span class="strong">Jagex Cup 2010</span>. In this edition, we�re taking an exclusive look at the initial plans for the Jagex Cup so that we can get your feedback, because, after all, it�s a competition for you all. More information on that later in the blog. As always, we want to hear about you, your clan and what you�re doing in the community. If you have something you�d like to have added to the page in future editions then send it on through to me at <span class="em">postbag@jagex.com</span> with 'Clan' in the title and I�ll see what I can do.</p><p><span class="strong">Mod Timbo</span> </p><p></p></div><div class="hr"></div><h3>Clan artwork</h3><div class="devblogimagecentre"><div class="imgcentre"><div class="centrecontainer"><div class="topbord"><div class="bottombord"><div class="leftbord"><div class="rightbord"><div class="toplcorn"><div class="toprcorn"><div class="bottomlcorn"><div class="bottomrcorn"><a href="images/clan_submissions/1004/clan_art_5.jpg"><img src="images/clan_submissions/1004/clan_art_5_thumb.jpg" alt="Artwork from Team Falcon, Destructive Pures and The Dutch Revolution" /></a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><a href="images/clan_submissions/1004/clan_art_5.jpg">Artwork from Team Falcon, Destructive Pures and The Dutch Revolution</a></div></div></div><br class="clear" /><div class="content"><p> </p><p></p></div><div class="hr"></div><h3>Staff interview: Mod Mat K, part 1</h3><div class="content"><p>Not only do we like to interview some of the most interesting clans in the community, we also interview members of staff who are involved with clans or have been during their RuneScape career. This month, I caught up with <span class="strong">Mod Mat K</span> to talk about clans. As a lot of people already know, <span class="em">Daddy K</span> was involved with the clan community before he joined Jagex and has been involved ever since - both in a personal and official sense. Now no longer working with clans, I thought I'd talk to him about his experiences, what he's learned and how he got introduced to the clan community.</p><p><span class="strong">Mod Timbo: How did you get introduced to the clan community from when you were playing RuneScape?</span> </p><p><span class="strong">Mod Mat K</span>: <span class="em">I am afraid that I have to blame my wife for that. Back in 2004, both my wife and I played RuneScape, and she joined a clan (whose name will remain secret). I came along to a few of their events and PK trips and soon after I joined too.</span> </p><p><span class="strong">Mod Timbo: What was the biggest lure to you from the clan community that made you stay?</span> </p><p><span class="strong">Mod Mat K</span>: <span class="em">Undeniably, it is the people that you meet and play with. Every day you would see someone being passionate about the clan, whether it be a warlord telling you off for piling the wrong person, recruitment drives or someone having a personal problem and looking for a bit of support. The passion, purpose and focus of being in a clan is very addictive.</span> </p><p><span class="strong">Mod Timbo: Which clans stood out to you over the years either from just talking, warring or being a part of them?</span> </p><p><span class="strong">Mod Mat K</span>: <span class="em">You know, I thought long and hard about this question. The easy answer would have been to say clans like <span class="strong">Damage Incorporated, Dark Slayers or Noobs Inc</span> - all are awesome clans - but I think that the clans that I remember the most are two clans that really stood out for me. The first is <span class="strong">THE clan</span> - every time I fought alongside or against them they were a good bunch of people with a great supportive mentality.</span></p><p><span class="em">The other clan that has stood out to me is <span class="strong">The Wilderness Guardians</span>, not least because of <span class="strong">His Lordship's</span> dedication to the clan community. He has been a forerunner in the clan community ever since I can remember.</span></p><p><span class="strong">Mod Timbo: Are you still involved with a clan today?</span> </p><p><span class="strong">Mod Mat K</span>: <span class="em">Once you are in the clan community, you are always involved with a clan... There is no escape.</span> </p><p>Continued further down... </p><p></p></div><div class="hr"></div><h3>Jagex Clan Cup 2010</h3><div class="devblogimagecentre"><div class="imgcentre"><div class="centrecontainer"><div class="topbord"><div class="bottombord"><div class="leftbord"><div class="rightbord"><div class="toplcorn"><div class="toprcorn"><div class="bottomlcorn"><div class="bottomrcorn"><a href="images/clan_submissions/1004/event.jpg"><img src="images/clan_submissions/1004/event_thumb.jpg" alt="Wicked Fury showing off their Prayer skills" /></a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><a href="images/clan_submissions/1004/event.jpg">Wicked Fury showing off their Prayer skills</a></div></div></div><br class="clear" /><div class="content"><p></p><p>Last year, we held our first large-scale competition called the <span class="strong">Jagex Cup</span>, which was designed to show who was the best clan in three categories: <span class="strong">combat, skilling</span> and a <span class="strong">combination</span> of the two. The competition was a great success and everyone that took part had a lot of fun with us finding out who the best three clans were:</p><p><span class="strong">The Titans - Combat Cup winners<br />Divination - Skilling Cup winners<br />Wicked Fury - Combination Cup winners</span></p><p>We took a lot of feedback from the players during the planning stages of last year�s competition that helped shape the competition and iron out a few creases with processes and rules. This is why we�re doing so again, so that your voice can be heard during the planning stages of the competition!</p><p>The full plan for the Jagex Cup 2010 can be found at this <a href="../m%3dforum/sl%3d6/forums.html?135,136,394,60902244">forum thread</a> that I�ve set up in the <a href="../m%3dforum/sl%3d6/forums.html?135,136">Clan Discussion forum</a>. If you would like to get involved with the planning, feedback and suggestions for this year�s competition, then sign in and get posting! Here is a quick list of changes made from last year to whet your appetite:<ul><li>Inclusion of sub-divisions to the Combat Cup to include a �pure� division, a P2P division and capped wars.</li><li>A clearer system of registering your players and your clan in the competition, including live member lists of each clan.</li><li>A new way of scoring a clan in the Skilling Cup with our <span class="em">�buddy skills�</span> method.</li></ul></p><p>I very much look forward to seeing your feedback and suggestions!</p><p><span class="strong">Mod Timbo</span></p><p></p></div><div class="hr"></div><h3>Clan Facts</h3><div class="content"><p>As a regular feature, we�ll be spotlighting a few of our clans from the community in different categories. Don�t worry if you�re clan doesn�t appear here and you think that it should; let us know via email at <span class="em">postbag@jagex.com</span> with �Clan� in the subject and we�ll see what we can do. </p><p>Some of our highest-level clans: <br /><span class="em">Team TKO Blitz, Violent Resoultion</span> and <span class="em">RuneScape Dinasty</span> </p><p>Some of our oldest clans: <br /><span class="em">Wilderness Guardians, Noobs Inc</span> and <span class="em">Dark Slayers</span> </p><p>Some of our more unusual clans: <br /><span class="em">Skillers of the Round Table, The Organisation of Assassins</span> and <span class="em">Friend Space</span> </p><p>Some of our newest and upcoming clans: <br /><span class="em">TheUpside, Agony of Defeat</span> and <span class="em">Ancient Slayers</span> </p><p></p></div><div class="hr"></div><h3>Clan Articles</h3><div class="content"><p>Every so often, we receive a number of articles about clans through Postie Pete's electronic mailbox and it's high time that we got to share them with you all! As always, if you have something that you'd like to write about and share with the community about clans, send it to us via <span class="em">postbag@jagex.com</span> with 'Clan' in the title so we can pick it out. Without any further ado, here is the article written by <span class="strong">Ocean Azure</span>. </p><p><span class="strong">About warring and having fun</span> <br /><span class="em">Written by Ocean Azure</span> </p><p>It seems the focal points of clans nowadays are centered around warring in attempt to gain recognition and enhance social status within the community. Motivational techniques, peer pressure and the constant reminder of clan loyalty often result in large amounts of money being spent on wars, lots of preparation, allot of passion and a general expectancy to win. Whilst the triumphant team experience feelings of joy and pride, and are congratulated for good teamwork, the defeated side experience quite the opposite. This in time leads division amongst clans and negative attitudes between them, where the losing side express their hate and disappointment through flaming/abusive language and the winning side emphasize their superiority over the other clan. This scenario does not relate to every single war that takes place, however it does accurately describe what generally does happen at most ranked wars. </p><p>What can we do to mend this? Where has the fun gone in wars? Why am I telling you this? All these questions will be answered shortly. </p><p><span class="strong">Oblivion</span> has a very different approach. We want our events to bring clans together, make our own community stronger and above all - for everyone to have a good time and enjoy themselves. One of the ways we do this is by exploring fun special events that range from Scavenger Hunts to Quizzes to Costumed Clan War Battles. Each Saturday Oblivion hosts a creative, odd and unusual event. These events are extremely rare and each event will only happen once every several months or only once a year. Here is a small report of one of our special events called Furious Ninja�s vs Spartan Warriors.</p><p>On Saturday the 10th of October 2009 around 40 members of Oblivion gathered at Clan wars at 8pm. Our leader handed out the outfits (for a small fee of course). The Spartans were given swords and shields whilst the Ninja�s were given knives and claws. After un-noting them at the nearby bank, the Spartan warriors and the Furious Ninja�s formed lines and diverged into their designated clan chats. The battle began. Would the brute force of the Spartans overcome the stealth and speed of the Furious Ninja�s?</p><p>The battle saw the Spartans attacking and the Ninja�s defending. The Spartans mighty roars echoing into the distance shook the very ground beneath their feet. The Ninja�s, unfazed had formed a cunning plan. The thud of the heavy Spartan boots suddenly drew closer. "They are coming!" a ninja cried. As soon as the first Spartan warrior came into sight, the ninja�s scattered confusing the Spartans. The Ninjas then sent their strongest to the front line. The Spartans immediately attacked them. As soon as the Ninjas had the attention of several Spartans they drew them out of their ranks opening large unprotected gaps in the Spartan team. The remaining Ninjas attacked the weakened side picking of easy targets. The Ninja�s could taste victory but Spartans never give up. The Spartan leader gathered the dispersed warriors together, and they bravely fought side by side wave after wave of Ninja�s. Outnumbered 2 to 1, the Spartans managed to wipe out a large chunk of the Ninja soldiers. </p><p>But the damage was already done, the game ended and the Ninja�s won the battle. After the event the Ninja�s applauded the brave Spartans who in the end put up a brave fight. The Spartans congratulated the organized Ninjas and everyone went home. The Ninjas had one this battle, but the Spartans knew it was not over. This was only the first of many more battles to come.</p><p></p></div><div class="hr"></div><h3>We want your submissions!</h3><div class="devblogimagecentre"><div class="imgcentre"><div class="centrecontainer"><div class="topbord"><div class="bottombord"><div class="leftbord"><div class="rightbord"><div class="toplcorn"><div class="toprcorn"><div class="bottomlcorn"><div class="bottomrcorn"><a href="images/clan_submissions/1004/submit.jpg"><img src="images/clan_submissions/1004/submit_thumb.jpg" alt="Everything's not always black or white!" /></a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><a href="images/clan_submissions/1004/submit.jpg">Everything's not always black or white!</a></div></div></div><br class="clear" /><div class="content"><p> </p><p>That�s right, YOU!

Are you a warring clanner, a skilling clanner or more of a social type?</span></p><p><span class="strong">Mod Mat K:</span> <span class="em">I enjoyed the wars, but when I lead a clan I was acutely aware that not everyone wanted to fight and die (multiple times) every night. So, we used to do several events every day, from Castle Wars to skilling competitions to Fishing Trawler trips (still my favourite non-combat event). So, the tl;dr versions is: loved warring, liked everything else.</span></p><p><span class="strong">Mod Timbo: How has your knowledge of the clan world helped you in your role at Jagex? Was your knowledge a factor in getting a role within Community Management?</span></p><p><span class="strong">Mod Mat K:</span> <span class="em">Actually, my move into Community Management (this was 2006) was more facilitated by me previously being a P-Mod, and I joined CM as a P-Mod curator; however, when we first started taking a more active role in the clan community, the fact I had been banging on about clans every day for two years meant I was a shoo-in. But then you know that because you were there too!</span></p><p><span class="strong">Mod Timbo: How long have you been playing RuneScape? Do you still keep in touch with your old clans?</span></p><p><span class="strong">Mod Mat K:</span> <span class="em">Over six years now, five of those while I have been working here. I still keep in touch with individuals that I met in the clan community, however, many of them don�t know it is me... Spooky!</span></p><p><span class="strong">Mod Timbo: Do you remember your first war with a clan? How did it feel and did you win?</span></p><p><span class="strong">Mod Mat K:</span> <span class="em">My first war was against a clan called The First Class. I don�t believe they are around anymore, though. They were primarily a New Zealand-based clan, so you can imagine the problems trying to arrange a convenient time between a mainly US/UK clan and a New Zealand one. The time zones were a nightmare. Oh, and we trounced them...and I have pics to prove that too. :p</span></p></div>

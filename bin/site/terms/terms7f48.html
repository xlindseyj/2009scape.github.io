Terms &amp; Conditions</b></p>
<p>
<b>
Introduction</b><br/>
This website is owned and operated by Jagex Limited ("Jagex"), a company registered in England and Wales (registered number 3982706). Our registered office is at St John's Innovation Centre, Cowley Road, Cambridge, CB4 0WS, United Kingdom. Our VAT number is 791 951 784.</p>
<p>
<b>
Definitions</b><br/>
"Jagex Product(s)" is used as shorthand for our online games including all Jagex websites used to play those games.</p>
<p>References to "Stopping" an account include all or any of: locking, temporarily or permanently banning, or temporarily or permanently muting the account. If your account is muted, you can continue to play but will not be able to use free text chat. If your account is banned, you will not be able to access your account at all. NB Membership credit continues to expire if accounts are muted or banned.</p>
<p>
<b>
Applicability</b><br/>
Please read these terms and conditions carefully. Your accepting them in full is a condition of your use of a Jagex product (whether or not you subscribe). If you don't agree with any part, please don't accept them or use the Jagex product.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about these terms and conditions, please contact us via email at <img style="vertical-align: bottom" src="../img/privacy/lawcontact.gif" alt=""/> and do not use the site until you are satisfied with and can accept these terms and conditions in full.</p>
<p>
<b>
Changes</b><br/>
We may change these terms and conditions to reflect: changes in applicable laws; regulatory or security requirements; relevant guidance or codes of practice; technical alterations to Jagex Products; and to improve clarity and consistency. Please check the terms and conditions whenever you use a Jagex Product. If you are not a subscriber, we will treat your continued use of a Jagex Product as acceptance of these changes from their effective date as shown above. If you are a subscriber, we will treat you as bound by the changes on the first renewal date for your subscription after the effective date and so you should cancel your subscription (as explained below) before this renewal date if you don't like the proposed changes.</p>
<p>
<b>
A SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT PRETEENS AND USERS UNDER 18</b><br/>
If you are under 13 you will be able to create an account but unable to disclose personal data through the game or website. If we find out that any personal data we have collected is from someone under 13, we will automatically delete it. We recommend that parents / guardians set up an account and play together with their children. Many parents have reported that playing Jagex Products as a family is fun and rewarding.</p>
<p>If you are under 13 and subscribe to the members' version of our game you are representing (i.e. making a promise) that you have consent from your parents / guardian to use Jagex Products in accordance with our terms and conditions and <a href="../privacy/privacy.html">privacy policy</a>. We may Stop any account if we are not satisfied that such consent has been given.</p>
<p>If you are under 18, by using our website you are representing (i.e. making a promise) that you have consent from your parents / guardian to use Jagex Products in accordance with our terms and conditions and <a href="../privacy/privacy.html">privacy policy</a>. We may Stop any account if we are not satisfied that such consent has been given.</p>
<p>If we are told by a parent / guardian that their child has lied about their age when registering for Jagex Products, we will Stop the account provided we have information which satisfies us that the reporting person is indeed the parent or guardian.</p>
<p>Parents can find more information about the game and how to contact us in the <a href="../../www.jagex.com/l%3d0/corporate/Parents_Guide/parents_guide.html" target="_blank">Parents' Guide</a>.</p>
<p>
<b>
Safety / abuse</b><br/>
Before using any Jagex Product you should read the guides found in our <a href="../kbase/guid/safety_and_security_guidelines.html">Safety &amp; Security Guidelines</a>. It is particularly important to read the <a href="../kbase/guid/play_safely.html">Play Safely Guide</a> and the
<a href="../kbase/guid/health_amp_safety.html">Health &amp; Safety Guide</a>.
Parents should review our safety materials in the <a href="../../www.jagex.com/l%3d0/corporate/Parents_Guide/safety.html" target="_blank">Player Safety</a> section of the <a href="../../www.jagex.com/l%3d0/corporate/Parents_Guide/parents_guide.html" target="_blank">Parents' Guide</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst we reserve the right to monitor and take action if any Jagex Product is used inappropriately (including the posting of objectionable material on the chat facility or otherwise), we cannot promise that any Jagex Product won't contain such content or that we will remove / modify any particular content. Nor can we guarantee that users will comply with our terms and conditions or otherwise behave appropriately.</p>
<p>If you are the victim of offensive or inappropriate behaviour or receive any other unwanted communications, you should use the built-in facilities to block the messages. (See <a href="../kbase/guid/controls_friends.html">this article</a> for guidance on blocking messages.) You should report all inappropriate behaviour to us via the in game <a href="../kbase/guid/how_do_i_report_abuse.html">"Report abuse"</a> button as well as seeking appropriate external help, for example from parents or law enforcement authorities. If you continue to suffer problems, or are not satisfied, then you must stop using the relevant Jagex Product(s).</p>
<p>

<b>
Our rights</b><br/>
If, acting reasonably, we consider that our Terms and Conditions have or may have been breached, or that there has been fraudulent, unlawful or abusive activity, or that it is necessary in order to prevent or stop any harm or damage to us, to any Jagex Product, to other players or the general public, we may Stop (as defined above) any or all accounts of Jagex Products which we think are connected with the offender subject to such right of appeal as is specified on our website and/or restrict access to or delete JCredits or anything acquired by means of JCredits. Such actions may result in loss of membership credit and/or loss of real money paid as part of any item / account trading or other prohibited transaction.</p>
<p>To prevent or remedy breach of our Terms and Conditions or any harm or damage to us, to any Jagex Product or to other players or the general public , we may automatically or manually monitor, censor (including rejection or removal of any content) and/or record public or private chat or other activities in any Jagex Product.</p>

<p>You agree that by submitting any material of any kind to us for any purpose connected with any Jagex Product (non-exhaustive examples are suggestions and ideas for any game or contributions to any Gallery page), you are giving us a non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to use and/or modify the submitted materials as we see fit.

Furthermore you guarantee that you are the exclusive copyright holder in relation to the submission and that the submission in no way breaches the rights of any other person or entity.</p>
<p>
<b>
Subscription</b><br/>
You need a subscription to use certain features of Jagex Products. If you apply for a subscription, you must ensure all the information that you submit is true and accurate (including without limit your credit card number and expiration date, and other payment details) and that you have appropriate parental or guardian consent as applicable. You agree to pay all subscription fees specified when you apply including all applicable taxes. Unless otherwise stated, all prices shown for EU countries include VAT.</p>
<p>By submitting your order you are making an offer to subscribe to the relevant part of the Jagex Product(s). Your offer is accepted and a binding contract occurs when we send a message to your account mail inbox confirming that your payment has been received or if you log into a subscribers-only part of a Jagex Product (whichever comes first).</p>

<p>Payments by credit cards are also subject to our <a href="../kbase/guid/credit_card_payment.html#agreeing">credit card agreement</a> which forms part of these terms and conditions.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to alter the amount or terms of our subscription fees at any time. This will only apply to those who, following the change, take out new subscriptions or re-subscribe (their previous subscriptions having expired) and specifically agree to the new fees / terms.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to charge you for any unauthorized use of your subscription by third parties.</p>
<p>
<b>

<p>
<b>
JCredits</b><br/>
In certain of our games, we offer JCredits for sale or, in our discretion, as free promotions. JCredits can be redeemed (ie used) to acquire certain digital goods / services, which we describe below as "Items". If you obtain JCredits, you must check that they have been correctly credited to your account and tell us immediately if not.</p>
<p>NB JCredits are subject to very important restrictions:</p>
<p>JCredits expire and will be deleted if they have not been redeemed within a certain period after acquisition so you should redeem them as soon as possible. The expiry period is whatever we specify when you acquire the JCredits or, if we haven't specified a time limit, three months from acquisition.</p>
<p>Unless we say otherwise on our website, JCredits can only be redeemed within the world of the game where you acquired them. We may at any time change or remove any or any type of Item for which JCredits can be redeemed as well as the amount of JCredits needed to acquire a particular Item. You may only redeem JCredits for Items on offer at the time of redemption.</p>
<p>JCredits do not have any inherent value and they are not your own private property. You can only use them to acquire those Items which we decide in our discretion to offer in return for JCredits. We do not provide any cash or refunds for JCredits (except as required by law). JCredits are for your personal use only. You must not sell or transfer them or make them available to anyone else or attempt to do so or encourage anyone else to do any of these things.</p>
<p>We may impose additional restrictions concerning the acquisition or redemption of JCredits. For example we may cap the amount of JCredits which can be acquired or held or redeemed in any particular period or we may impose restrictions based on your country of residence.</p>
<p>We may restrict access to or delete JCredits or Items: (1) as outlined under "Our Rights" above; (2) if the JCredits were awarded in error; or (3) if a payment for JCredits is charged back or otherwise cancelled or reversed.</p>
<p>We may at any time decide to end the entire JCredit program for all or any of our games. Before we delete the unused JCredits, we will endeavour to give you at least four weeks to redeem them.</p>
<p>
<b>

<p>
<b>
General</b><br/>
Nothing in these terms and conditions affects your statutory rights as a consumer. Headings above are for guidance only and not binding. If we fail to enforce any provision of these terms and conditions, that failure will not preclude us from enforcing either that provision (or any similar provision) on a later occasion.

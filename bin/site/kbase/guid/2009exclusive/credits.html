                                                                    As many of you know Credits are 100% exclusive to 2009scape. But what are credits you ask?
                                                                    Credits are the 2009scape's currency for rare items. Is it like a donator shop? With it's own

                                                                    Credits are our way of saying thank you for doing something. I'm going to go over all the different

                                                                    <img src="./../Images/credits/menu.png" height="300" width="500" style="margin-left: 13%; margin-top: 1%;">

                                                                    Once you've voted, take a screenshot of your page, and then post inside of the #claim-to-fame section of Discord.
